Implementation of DES Algorythm

The program provide encryption of a 64 bit string using a 64 bit key. Input prevents from wrong input text, key and hexadecimal code.

Option 1 -> user enters text of any size and key (maximum 64 bit) using characters

Option 2 -> user enters text of any size and key (maximum 64 bit) in hexadecimal form

Option 3 -> user enters text, key to text_data.txt in form of two 64 bit arrays, separated by blank sign

Option 4 -> user enters hexadecimal text, hexadecimal key to text_hex.txt in form of two 64 bit arrays, separated by blank sign

Output of a DES is encrypted text in binary,decimal and hexadecimal form.
